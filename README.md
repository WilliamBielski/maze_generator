# maze_generator
The quest to make kids' menu mazes begins

anyone planning to run this program will need to do a few things
1. you need a new-ish python (i personally didn't need to update mine)
2. set up a virtual environment through powershell commands(please make sure these comands work for your system. These commands are for Windows. if you have done this you only need step 2 to turn the environment on)
    1) python -m venv venv
    2) .\venv\Scripts\activate
    3) python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
3. run program through python
    1) python app.py
